# Java Algorithms & OOP Practice ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

Welcome to my personal collection of **50+ Java exercises** that focus on two critical areas for any backend developer:  
ðŸ”¸ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
ðŸ”¸ **Algorithm & Problem Solving**

Whether you're preparing for technical interviews, reinforcing your Java fundamentals, or just love solving logical problems â€” you're in the right place.

## âœ¨ What's Inside?

This repository includes:

- âœ… Real-life coding scenarios using Java
- âœ… Abstract classes & interfaces
- âœ… Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- âœ… Loops, conditionals, recursion
- âœ… Number theory exercises (e.g., perfect numbers, amicable numbers)
- âœ… Basic algorithmic challenges for interviews

All exercises are written in plain Java (no frameworks), so you can run them in any IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Built This

As a Java backend developer, I wanted to **sharpen my problem-solving skills** while also **helping others** learn by example.

I believe that **sharing knowledge accelerates learning**, so I made this repository public.  
If even one developer benefits from this, it's already worth it. ðŸ˜Š
